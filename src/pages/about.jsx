          <h2>About Me, A Quick Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Hello there! I'm Ziad Elraggal, a second-year Computer
            Engineering student at Memorial University of Newfoundland and
            Labrador. My journey involves delving into the exciting world of
            computer engineering, fueled by a genuine passion for the field.
            With each day, I bring dedication, motivation, and a strong drive
            to succeed in this captivating domain.
            <br /><br />
            With a solid foundation in multiple integral skills such as
            Python, C++, MATLAB, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and cybersecurity, I
            bring a diverse set of capabilities to the table with an eagerness
            to further learn and improve. I believe that there is always more
            out there to know and I cannot wait to utilize my skills and
            eagerness to become a better computer engineer.

          <h2>My Projects and Experiences, a Sneak Peek</h2>
          <p>
            While still at the beginning of my university journey, with ample
            room to learn and grow, I have been fortunate to participate in
            numerous projects and volunteer opportunities. I have completed
            one four-month-long co-op work term and eagerly anticipate many
            more. <br /><br /> Though my work experiences may be relatively
            brief, the knowledge gained during these experiences has been
            invaluable. Alongside my myriad of projects and volunteer
            endeavors, these experiences have enhanced my skillset, providing
            me with a head-start in this competitive field that I am eagerly
            looking forward to contribute to. You can find detailed accounts
            of my experiences and projects in their own dedicated section on
            this page.

          <h2>Aside From The Technical Aspect</h2>
          <p>
            Apart from my technical skills, I excel in time management,
            leadership roles, teamwork, hosting large-scale events, and
            project management. Through my extensive involvement in long-term
            volunteer roles, I have consistently contributed to and taken
            pride in my community. I derive joy and a sense of fulfillment
            from collaborating with individuals from diverse backgrounds to
            achieve a common goal.<br /><br /> The people I have met during
            these endeavors have profoundly influenced my perspective on life,
            offering incredibly diverse and unique viewpoints. This is
            precisely why I thrive in social environments, whether at work,
            organizing events, or running campaigns. However, I am equally
            capable of working independently. With each new experience, I
            strive to enhance these skills, as I firmly believe that the
            technical aspect of work is only half the equation.
